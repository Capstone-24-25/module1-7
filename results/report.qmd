## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

## Findings

#### Log Transformation

The purpose of Log-transforming protein values in a data set is done to address the distribution of the raw values. The data follows a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution, meaning there are many small values and a few very large values. This skew can make it difficult to analyze patterns and correlations, as the larger values can overly influence results.

When we apply a log transformation, we would reduce the impact of the extreme high values, therefore making the distribution more symmetric and closer to a normal distribution. This action would bring outliers closer to the main body data, which would stabilize variance and improve the performance of models. Additionally, it could make the relationships between the variables more linear, which would ensure that in analyses the results will not be overly influenced by extreme values.
