## Abstract

Do at the end

## Dataset



## Summary of published analysis

Summarize the methodology of the paper in 1-3 paragraphs. You need not explain the methods in depth as we did in class; just indicate what methods were used and how they were combined. If possible, include a diagram that depicts the methodological design. (Quarto has support for [GraphViz and Mermaid flowcharts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html).) Provide key results: the proteins selected for the classifier and the estimated accuracy.

## Findings

### Impact of preprocessing and outliers

#### Question 1

The purpose of Log-transforming protein values in a data set is done to address the distribution of the raw values. The data follows a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution, meaning there are many small values and a few very large values. This skew can make it difficult to analyze patterns and correlations, as the larger values can overly influence results.

When we apply a log transformation, we would reduce the impact of the extreme high values, therefore making the distribution more symmetric and closer to a normal distribution. This action would bring outliers closer to the main body data, which would stabilize variance and improve the performance of models. Additionally, it could make the relationships between the variables more linear, which would ensure that in analyses the results will not be overly influenced by extreme values.

#### Question 2

### Methodlogical variations

#### Question 3 
Our code splits the data into training and test sets at the beginning with biomarker_split, and the feature selection is performed on biomarker_train. This setup ensures that the test set (biomarker_test) remains untouched until the final evaluation, so this requirement is already met in the code. 
By performing feature selection only on the training set, we avoid information leakage into the test set, leading to a more unbiased estimate of the model's performance. This approach ensures that the test set is purely "unseen" data, providing a more reliable measure of how the model will perform in real-world scenarios. 
Secondly, We increased the number of selected proteins which allows for a broader range of potentially relevant features, which might capture more nuanced relationships between proteins and the outcome (ASD vs. TD). However, selecting more proteins may also introduce some noise if the added proteins are less predictive.
Thirdly, we used Weighted Combination of Ranks as the fuzzy intersection method, combining ranks from the t-tests and random forest based on significance and importance scores. The fuzzy intersection generally improves model generalization and robustness. By allowing flexibility, the model can retain proteins that may contribute meaningfully to predictions even if theyâ€™re not strictly top-ranked in both methods. This can enhance accuracy and ROC AUC without sacrificing sensitivity, as meaningful proteins from each selection method are retaineds.
